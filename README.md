## Description
This repository contains calibrations for assembly bias with tidal anisotropy in the Lognormal Framework described in our paper. It also contains calibrations for assembly bias with any Gaussian/Gaussian-transformable secondary halo property. 
The Jupyter notebook /demo_jupyternb/demo.ipynb contains few examples demonstrating usage of the code and reproduces some of the plots in arXiv:2007.03711.
The launch binder icon above can be used to view an interactive online version of the same.
